<h4> Hex Board Implementation</h4>
<h3> The Game of Hex</h3>
<p>The game of Hex has been invented in 1942 by Piet Hein, reinvented in 1948 by John Nash, got its name in 1952 from a commercial distribution by Parker Brothers
  and has been popularized by Martin Gardner in 1957. It is similar to tic-tac-toe on a hexagonal 11x11 board.</p><?/br>Given is the image link:

<p>The blue player must make a connected set of blue hexagons from east to west. The red player must do the same from north to south. At each turn a player chooses an unoccupied hexagon and gives it their color.  Unlike tic-tac-toe the game cannot end in a draw. Indeed it can be proven that by best play the first player wins.(John Nash). However there is no known optimal strategy.</p>
<h3>What's the program about?</h3>
<p>This program implements a simple board display which would is an 11 x 11 printout with X, O, or a blank in each position. It has a simple way to input a move i.e having the player enter an (i,j) coordinate corresponding to a currently empty hexagon. The program checks whether that's legal and if not asks for another choice.
An example output is given in output.txt.</p>
