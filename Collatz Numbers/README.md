Assignment-1:Computation of Collatz Numbers
*************************************************************************************************************
User- Instructions:
* Assgn1Src-EE19BTECH11033.cpp- The cpp program for the Collatz conjecture
* Assgn1Report-EE19BTECH11033.pdf- Report containing the low level execution details of the program.
To run the program:
* Open the terminal, and go to the directory where the program is saved.
* To compile the program, enter the command :
  "g++ Assgn1Src-EE19BTECH11033.cpp -o Assgn1Src-EE19BTECH11033"
* To execute the compiled program, enter the command:
  "./Assgn1Src-EE19BTECH11033"


Using the program:
The program would prompt the user to enter the input. The user has to type in a positive integer and click “Enter”. The program would output the sequence of collatz numbers for the input number.
