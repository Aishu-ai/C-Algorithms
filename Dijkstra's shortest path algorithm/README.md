This is a <b>Monte Carlo simulation</b> that calculates the average shortest path in a graph. The graph has been generated using a pseudo-random number generator to
produce edges and their costs. The shortest path algorithm is Dijkstraâ€™s. </br>
An edge will have a positive cost that is its distance.  Assume the graphs are undirected. The random graph procedure has edge density as a parameter 
and distance range as a parameter.The edge distance would be selected at random from the distance range. So a graph whose density is 0.1 would have 10% of 
its edges picked at random and its edge distance would be selected at random from the distance range.
